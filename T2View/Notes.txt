When building a rather large application, I recommend the following additional folders (especially if you are using some kind of MVC- / ORM-Framework like express or mongoose):
./ Root
	core node application
/models contains all your ORM models (called Schemas in mongoose)
/views contains your view-templates (using any templating language supported in express)
/public contains all static content (images, style-sheets, client-side JavaScript)
/assets/images contains image files
/assets/pdf contains static pdf files
/css contains style sheets (or compiled output by a css engine)
/js contains client side JavaScript
/controllers contain all your express routes, separated by module/area of your application (note: when using the bootstrapping functionality of express, this folder is called /routes)
