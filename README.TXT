These threat lists are updated at fairly regular, but not set, intervals based on the accumulated data across several security appliances in addition to data collected from other security vendors (AlienVault OTX, Virus Total, URLVoid, FortiGuard Labs)

**Note that once an IP or URL makes it on to one of these lists, it is very hard get them removed unless specifically requested by a customer.


Similarly to the various security vendors the domains have been broken into categories; though perhaps not the same categories as the vendors themselves.  The categories include:
--Whitelist Categories -
VoIP Services
Banking
Investment
Shopping
Misc Sites


--Blacklist Categories -
Fake News
Games
Video Streaming
Audio Streaming

--Public Threat lists

** This list may be updated based on ingested data or customer needs.
